          <h2>Early <span class="navy">Years</span></h2>
          <p>
            Football has been a Bluefield tradition well before Bluefield High School was created. Beaver
            High School was the first high school in the Bluefield area. The location of classes changed 
            from place to place during the early years of it's existence until a building was finally 
            erected in 1911. The first Beaver football team formed in 1908. They played inner city schools
            such as Genoa and Park Central during it's existence. Beaver would play their games a couple
            blocks away at Wade School. The Beaver football squad experienced an undefeated season in 1940, 
            but would not be selected to play in the state championship. Beaver High School's building
            began to age. Therefore, a replacement was soon built and named Bluefield High School. The 
            school decided that their mascot should be a beaver as a homage to the old school and became 
            The Bluefield Beavers. With a new building and mascot, Bluefield High School was looking 
            forward to an exciting future. They hired Big Creek High School legend Merrill Gainer as their
            new head coach and received immediate success in the AAA division.

          <h2>Merrill Gainer <span class="navy">Era</span></h2>
          <p>
            Merrill Gainer was the first head football coach of Bluefield High School. He started in 1959
            and would coach until 1967. During his time at Bluefield High School he went 87-6-1. He 
            currently holds the highest winning percentage at the school, an astounding .925. Gainer lead
            the Beavers to four state championships (1959, 1962, 1965, 1967). While coaching at Bluefield 
            High School, Gainer had a 50% chance of winning a state championship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bluefield High School's first year of football saw a state championship. Led by players such
            as Bill Kenser, Richard Bourne, and Jabo Williams, the Beavers had immediate success. They 
            defeated teams from schools such as Graham, Richlands, Gary, and Oak Hill. The Beavers beat
            the Princeton Tigers to finish the regular season undefeated. They would go on to play the
            mighty Big Reds of Parkersburg High School in the state championship. Several thousands of
            Beaver fans crowded Laidley Field in Charleston, West Virginia and watched Bluefield pull out
            the 19-13 victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Beavers had a second undefeated season in 1960, but were not invited back to the state 
            championship. Gainer led the Beavers back to the state championship in 1962 and won. The
            Beavers again faced Parkersburg High School, only this time it was not as close of a contest. 
            The Beavers routed the Big Reds 40-12. Johnny Land and Johnny Disibbio both were the leading 
            scorers for the Beavers, each with three touchdowns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gainer again went through another three year period of not being invited to the state 
            championship. His undefeated Beavers finally made it back in 1965 for what would be the third
            championship in the program's six years of existence. The Beavers played against a new opponent, 
            Dunbar High School, and held them scoreless. It was not the blowout that was delivered to 
            Parkersburg three years before, it was a much closer score of 13-0. Bluefield quarterback 
            Dickie Ward threw for 14 touchdowns during the regular season, but did not complete a pass the
            entire game. The Beavers defense proved to be the focal point of the game as the Beavers allowed
            201 yards but no scores.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gainer's last season as the head coach at Bluefield High School proved to be a successful one.
            The Beavers won their fourth state championship in the program's eighth year. The effort was 
            lead by Nick Colobro, Pete Sarver, and Ronnie Goowin as the Beavers defeated Stonewall Jackson
            27-7. Bluefield scored twenty unanswered in the first half and scored their final touchdown on
            the first drive of the second half. The Beavers defense was again a huge factor in the outcome
            of the game, for they held Stonewall Jackson to 117 yards and only 14 of those being passing 
            yards.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Gainer left Bluefield High School he went to Patrick Henry High School in Roanoke VA 
            where he led the Patriots to what would be his final championship in 1973. Gainer lived until 
            he was 87 years old. His impact has been felt for many years by hundreds of people. Some say 
            that if he had not coached at Bluefield High School they would not be as prestigious as they 
            are today.

        <div>
          <h2>John Chmara <span class="navy">Era</span></h2>
          <p>
            John Chmara became the second head football coach of Bluefield High School in 1968. During
            his time coaching at Bluefield High School, he went 130-53-1. Chmara coached the Beavers from
            1968 to 1985. He was given big shoes to fill and he filled them to the best of his ability.
            Chmara led the Beavers to two state championships (1975 and 1984). He had two undefeated 
            seasons in 1968 and 1972, but was not invited to the state chamionship. There was an eight
            year period where Bluefield High School had not played in the state championship, the longest
            in the program's history up to that point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relief would come in 1975 when the Beavers beat South Charleston 20-7 for their fifth state
            championship. Chmara's first championship was led by Donnie Jackson and Joey Beckett. It was
            a close game yard wise, both teams had 210 rushing, but the Beavers had more first downs and
            capitalized when they needed to. The Beavers would go through a nine year period of not 
            playing in the state championship until 1984.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chmara won his second and final state championship in 1984. It was also the last the Beavers
            would win in class AAA. Bluefield defeated Barboursville 13-7 in the closest championship 
            game since the very first against Parkersburg. Hugh Smalls proved to be the big man on campus
            and ran for 152 yards on 21 carries. The game remained scoreless until the third quarter when
            the Beavers capitalized on a 70 yard drive. Bluefield then recovered a surprise onside kick
            and scored on the same drive. The Beavers upheld the victory and won in dominating fashion.
          </p>
          <p>
            John Chmara left an impact on his time as coach just as Merrill Gainer did. He passed away 
            in 2003, and Bluefield High School added "Chmara Blue" as one of school colors. Chmara's
            wife, Mary Chmara, is still active at Bluefield High School, and helped build the school's 
            library in 1998.

          <h2>Fred Simon <span class="navy">Era</span></h2>
          <p>
            Fred Simon became the third and current head coach of Bluefield High School in 1986. During 
            his time coaching the Beavers, he has gone 311-152. Simon has won more games and coached 
            more years than any other coach in school history. He has led Bluefield High School to five
            state championships (1997, 2004, 2007, 2009, and 2017). He's had four undefeated seasons in
            1997, 2004, 2007, and 2017. He coached during the longest period between state championships
            to day, from 1984 to 1997 (13 years).
          </p>
          <p>
            Fred Simon's career at Bluefield High School was a rough start compared to his predecessors.
            He would not win a state championship until his eleventh season as head coach. It would come
            in 1997 when Bluefield destroyed Grafton 42-13. Charlie Tynes led the Beavers with 84 rushing
            yards and three touchdowns. The Beaver defense was the biggest part of the game, forcing five
            interceptions. The victory was the seventh state championship in school history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another championship drought occurred after the win. It lasted seven years until 2004, when
            Simon led an undefeated Beaver team into Wheeling and blew out rival Wayne 69-24. Bluefield's
            defense was again the deciding factor of the game, for they recovered six fumbles and received
            two interceptions. Bluefield kicker Lucas Stone set a class AA championship record when he 
            completed a 41 yard field goal. This victory was the eighth state championship in Bluefield
            history and jump started a successful slew of championships for Simon comparable to Gainer's
            coaching days.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Beavers topped off an undefeated season with a 20-12 victory over James Monroe in 2007.
            It was Simon's third state championship and the school's ninth. James Monroe attacked early 
            with nine unanswered points. Shaun Brooks ran 51 yards for the first Bluefield score of the 
            day, but James Monroe had a 12-7 lead at halftime. Will Cole threw two touchdowns in the 
            second half to lead the Beavers to a 20-12 victory over the Mavericks. Simon would have 
            success again shortly after the 2007 season.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2009, in order to reach the number one Wayne Pioneers in the championship game, Bluefield
            had to beat number three Sherman and number two Magnolia. They would go on to beat Wayne 27-7
            and win their tenth state championship, Simon's fourth. Marcus Paterson had a 98 yard 
            interception return for a touchdown to start the game and break the state championship record.
            The team leaders were Jake Lilly and Paterson, who led the team on offense and defense. Levi
            Beckett was the quarterback in the game, continuing a long Beckett-Bluefield tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, after an 8 year championship drought, and after yet another undefeated season, the
            Beavers finally made their way back to Wheeling to face the Polar Bears of Fairmont Senior in
            the championship game. Led by the school's all-time leading rusher in Latrell "Mookie" Collier
            and fullback Jason "Truck" Edwards and a solid line on both sides of the ball, the Beavers
            pulled off a 29-26 victory in the game for their 11th state championship and 5th championship
            under Simon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fred Simon is undoubtedly one of the most important coaches in Bluefield High School history.
            He has the most wins and is tied with the most championships. It's unclear how long Simon's
            future is with the Beavers, but based on his past it will most likely be successful. Simon's
            winning percentage is .672.

          <h2>Beaver/Graham <span class="navy">Rivalry</span></h2>
          <p>
            The Beaver-Graham Game (Beaver-Graham) is an annually played game between Bluefield High School
            and Graham High School. The game is held at Mitchell Stadium and usually brings a capacity 
            crowd. The first game was played in 1911 and was won 17-5 by the Beavers. There have been 99
            games between the schools, and Bluefield leads the series 70-27-2(.714). In 1991 the game was
            featured on ESPN by Scholastic Sports America which features some of the nation's most storied
            high school football rivalries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Held annually as the first game of the season in an 89-year-old stadium, the Beaver-Graham
            football game may very well be one of the longest-running and well-known high school 
            football rivalries in the United States. In the parking lot outside of Mitchell Stadium, the
            atmosphere is more like a happy community reunion that straddles both sides of the West 
            Virginia-Virginia State Line. If it's a heated rivalry on the football field, off the field
            it's unquestionably a friendly one. The first game between the Graham G-men and the 
            Bluefield Beavers dates back to 1911. The two did not play each other again until 1928, 
            after that year they played every year until 2020 when the Virginia high school football 
            season was cancelled due to the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">Covid-19</a> 
            virus. The game was postponed again in 2021 for the same reason, however the game was able
            to be made up and played on a later date that season. The two towns come together for many
            events, but this is one where they separate and say pick a side.
